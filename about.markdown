The BuyingBricks data mining algorithm identifies LEGO sets that have a part-out value that exceeds our preset ROI threshold. We then calculate a more conservative ROI taking into account the market volume for individual pieces and the risk associated with certain types of pieces. Finally, our algorithm usually uses day-to-day prices as found on Amazon and does not depend on special deals or discounts to come up with good ROI sets and making sure you can grow your store consistently.

We have been running our own BrickLink store based on the input of this algorithm successfully and since May 2020 we are providing weekly reports on this website.

In the (near) future we aim to make this available through other channels to which you could subscribe. Drop us a note on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@BuyingBricks,%20I%20have%20an%20idea) if this is something that interests you. 

We are starting with support for the EU market, but plan to expand beyond Europe.
